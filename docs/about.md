## About the Site
These notes are provided for students enrolled in the Summer II session of
ENAE/ENME202 at the University of Maryland.
They are complementary to the lecture material, meaning they expand on concepts
introduced in lecture and provide multiple examples.
All examples are downloadable for students' convenience, and the expected output
is included in the notes. These notes are linkable and searchable,
to provide quick access to information.
