[C++](https://cplusplus.com/) is a widely-used, high-level programming language.
It is known for its versatility and efficiency.
C++ extends the capabilities of the C programming language by incorporating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles,
making it suitable for developing complex software systems.
C++ is commonly used in various fields of engineering, due to its ability to handle low-level memory manipulation and
multiple programming paradigms.
With its rich standard library and powerful features, C++ allows engineers to create high-performance programs and software. It is a solid foundation for advanced computing.
