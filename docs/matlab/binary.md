## Introduction
The binary system is a method of representing numbers using only two symbols: 0 and 1.
Unlike the decimal system, which uses ten digits (0–9) to represent numbers, binary uses only these two states.
Binary is a base-2 system, meaning each digit, or "bit," represents a power of 2.

For example:

Binary 101 equals decimal 5 because $1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5$

*A diagram showing a binary number (e.g., 1011) with labeled powers of 2 and its decimal conversion process would be helpful here.*

## Why Binary in Computers?
Computers use binary because they operate on electrical signals, which have two distinct states: on and off.
Either current is flowing or it is not.
These states can easily be represented as 1 (on) and 0 (off) in binary.
This simplicity allows for reliable data representation and processing within electronic circuits.

## How Computers Use Binary
1. Data Representation: Every piece of data in a computer—whether it's text, images, audio, or video—is ultimately stored as binary numbers. For example:

 * A single character, like 'A', is represented by a binary code using standards such as ASCII. 'A' in ASCII is 01000001.

*A table comparing a few characters (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C') and their binary ASCII values would make this section clearer.*

2. Logic and Operations: Binary is the foundation of logic gates, which are the building blocks of a computer's processor. Logic gates perform operations like AND, OR, and NOT using binary input. For example:

 * The AND gate outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1.

*A diagram of a basic AND gate with its binary truth table would help visualize this concept.*

3. Storage: Binary is also used in computer memory. A bit is the smallest unit of data, and groups of 8 bits form a byte, which is the standard unit for storing information. For instance:

 * The letter 'A' takes 1 byte, represented as 01000001 in memory.

*A figure showing how bits combine to form bytes and how bytes are used to store larger data (e.g., a string or image) could clarify this idea.*

4. Arithmetic Operations: Computers perform calculations in binary. For example, adding two binary numbers like 101 and 011 follows the same rules as decimal addition, with carryovers:

```text
    101
  + 011
  -----
   1000
```

*An illustration of binary addition, showing each step in the carryover process, would be particularly useful.*

## The Importance of Binary
The binary system is fundamental to the operation of modern mechanical and aerospace engineering systems.
From controlling the precise movements of robotic arms in manufacturing to managing the complex navigation systems of spacecraft, binary enables reliable communication between software and hardware.
For example, binary data streams are critical in processing sensor readings and executing control algorithms in real-time, ensuring that engines operate efficiently or that an aircraft adjusts its flight path accurately.
By understanding binary, engineers gain insight into how digital signals translate into physical actions, forming the foundation for innovation in these advanced fields.
