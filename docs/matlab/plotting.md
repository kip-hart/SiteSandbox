title: Plotting
---

In engineering, we visualize the relationship between variables to understand their behavior and to communicate results with our peers.
MATLAB includes several useful tools for creating plots such as line graphs, contour plots, and 3D surfaces.
Knowing how to present your findings is just as valuable as generating them, and plots are one way to present your data.
