title: Getting Started with MATLAB

## Download and Installation
To download and install MATLAB on your computer,
follow the instructions on the TERPware 
[MATLAB for Students - Access for Everyone](https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/1849)
website.
This is the preferred way to use MATLAB in this course.

### Alternative 1: Virtual Computer Lab
If you cannot install MATLAB on a personal computer, you can still access it through
the [Virtual Computer Lab](https://eit.umd.edu/facilities/vcl).
If you are not on-campus, you will need to VPN to access the VCL.
Please take care to save your work somewhere you can retrieve it after closing the VCL session.
See the [Citrix Virtual Computer Lab (VCL)](https://ask.eng.umd.edu/105228) FAQ for details.

### Alternative 2: MATLAB Online
Another option to access MATLAB is through [MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/).
This is an entirely cloud-based solution, where files live and run on MATLAB's servers.
It should be treated as a last resort since you are depending on their servers being
up 100% of the time while you're coding.

MATLAB Online is also a relatively new tool.
There may be some differences between how it works and the local program.
These course notes do not take those differences into account.
