This function contains the unit conversion factors for metric and
Imperial units. It demonstrates these concepts:

* Fuctions
* Structures
* Switch/case statements
* Defensive programming
* Help strings

In your coursework, you will encounter physical constants defined in metric,
while working on a problem with givens that are Imperial.

**Don't let units be a barrier.**

Instead, convert all your inputs to the same unit system, calculate your
answer, and choose which units to use for your output.
Using this function in homework for other classes will help you avoid unit conversion mistakes!
