A MATLAB script is a text file with the extension `.m` containing a sequence of MATLAB commands.
Scripts can be run from the Command Window, executing the entire sequence in a single step.
Scripts can also contain comments, which is text that MATLAB ignores during execution.
Comments are an excellent way to organize the script, leave notes about the sources of data or formulas, and include metadata about the script.

While scripts themselves are simple plain text files, MATLAB can create PDF files with formatted text, the code, and the outputs of the script.
This process is called publishing the script, and can be useful for completing homework assignments.
MATLAB live scripts work like published scripts, but have the benefit of showing the results instantly - live.
