## Introduction
Computation, at its core, involves the processing of data and execution of instructions to solve problems.
From ancient mechanical devices to modern supercomputers, the field of computation has revolutionized how
engineers, scientists, and mathematicians address complex challenges.

Modern engineers often perform computations on personal computers, when it would be more time-intensive or
error-prone to do by hand.
Some computations, such as simulating turbulent flows, may grow beyond the limits of a personal computer and require
the use of computer clusters.
Others may be performed remotely, such as a rocket steering itself through launch.
This page highlights the most important computing advances through history, from the abacus to the modern computer.

## Early Beginnings: Mechanical Computation
The foundations of computation began with mechanical devices designed to aid calculations.
Ancient cultures like the Babylonians and Egyptians used tools such as the abacus for arithmetic tasks.
Farmers, for example, would use the abacus to track how many heads of cattle they owned.
The Inca used a system of knots to both add large numbers and record the individual terms of the sum.

A significant leap occurred in 1614, when [John Napier](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Napier) invented logarithms.
In the early 1620s, [William Oughtred](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Oughtred) invented the slide rule and fundamentally changed the way we performed multiplication, division, exponentiation, trigonometry, and solving the quadratic formula.
Use of the slide rule only declined in the 1970s when they were replaced by handheld calculators.
To learn more about multiplying and dividing with a slide rule, visit [Basic Slide Rule Use](https://efcms.engr.utk.edu/ef105-2024-01/slide_rule_fun.pdf).

Glenn L. Martin Hall, on the University of Maryland College Park campus,
was designed to look like a slide rule from above. ([aerial view](https://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/58268))

It is worth noting at this point that the abacus adds and subtracts in discrete steps, while the slide rule is continuous.
For example, an abacus cannot add an irrational number (e.g. $$\pi$$) without rounding first.
Slide rules can be used without rounding, limited instead by the user's ability to line up the rules and cursor.
Though this may seem like an advantage for continuous computing machines, discrete machines would overtake them as technology advanced. 
Finer resolution, analogous to having many rows on an abacus for the tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and so on, would make round-off error nearly imperceptible.

## The Age of Machines: 17th to 19th Century
While the slide rule accelerated a long list of mathematical operations, addition and subtraction were not on that list.
Decades later in 1642, [Blaise Pascal](https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/blaise-pascal) invented the Pascaline: a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction.
It used a series of interlocking gears and dials, where each dial represented a digit.
Turning the dials would rotate the gears, calculating sums and differences automatically.

[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](http://ds-wordpress.haverford.edu/bitbybit/bit-by-bit-contents/chapter-one/1-8-leibniz-and-the-stepped-reckoner/)
improved on the Pascaline in 1673 with the invention of the Leibniz wheel.
The wheel was a gear where the teeth had different widths,
so adding a specific number was a matter of sliding the wheel to set how many teeth engaged an axle.
All four fundamental arithmetic operations could be performed with a single Leibniz step reckoner,
a machine with a Leibniz wheel representing each of the tens places.
The stepped reckoner would remain the primary arithmetic machine in use for the next 150 years.

The Industrial Revolution enabled mass production of nearly everything, including textiles and arithmetic machines.
In 1804, [Joseph Marie Jacquard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Marie-Jacquard) invented a programmable loom that could weave a wide variety of complex patterns,
with each pattern punched into a sequence of cards.
This improvement in automation, along with several other innovations, lead to significant job losses for skilled textile workers,
ignited conflicts across England, and highlighted the social impact of automating people's jobs.
In 1820, [Charles Xavier Thomas](http://ds-wordpress.haverford.edu/bitbybit/bit-by-bit-contents/chapter-two/the-arithmometer-and-numerical-tables/)
used the same operating principles as the step reckoner, improving on it with a design that could be mass produced.
His design would not reach the market until 1851, in part due to a shift in the British government's focus to the difference
engine invented by [Charles Babbage](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Babbage).

The Babbage [difference engine](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Difference-Engine) was notable for its ability to evaluate polynomials.
Previously, transcendental functions like sine and cosine were evaluated by looking up values in tables.
The publishers for these tables calculated and recorded values by hand - for a limited number of angles.
Babbage wanted to eliminate all sources of human error from tabulating these values and devised a machine that could
calculate the next row in a table based on the previous row and some intermediate values.
It was known for a century by this point that these functions could be approximated by a polynomial series, such as

$$\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + ...$$

Babbage's difference engine could be set with the coefficients of a polynomial, then evaluated for a specific input value.
Charles Babbage spent 19 years developing and building the difference engine, 
abandoning the project to create a programmable machine like the Jacquard looms - an engine capable of performing any sequence of calculations.
He set to work on the mechanical design of an [analytical engine](https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/adalovelace/2018/07/26/ada-lovelace-and-the-analytical-engine/), while [Ada Lovelace](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ada-Lovelace) wrote instructions for the machine, making her the first computer programmer.

### Example: Finite Difference Table
#### Question
{:.no_toc}
Compute the first 5 entries in a finite difference table for the polynomial $f(x) = x-1000 x^5$, starting from $x=0$ and using a step size of $\Delta x = 0.01$. 
Compare the final value of $f(x)$ in the table with $sin(x)$ computed by calculator and find the percent error.
Use the following pre-computed differences:

| $x$ | $f(x)$ | $\Delta f$ | $\Delta_2 f$ | $\Delta_3 f$ | $\Delta_4 f$ | $\Delta_5 f$ |
|-----|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|   0 |      0 |       0.01 |        -3e-6 |       -1.5e5 |      -2.4e-5 |      -1.2e-5 |


#### Solution
{:.no_toc}

We start by populating the first row with the pre-computed differences.
In the next row, $\Delta_5$ remains constant, while $\Delta_4^{(new)}=\Delta_4^{(old)} + \Delta_5^{(old)}$.
The same applies for $\Delta_3$ and so on for the entire row.
This procedure is repeated for each row until we have 5 new rows.
Values below are given with 3 significant digits, but calculated with machine precision.

| $x$    | $f(x)$    | $\Delta f$ | $\Delta_2 f$ | $\Delta_3 f$ | $\Delta_4 f$ | $\Delta_5 f$ |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0      |      0    |       0.01 |     -3.00e-6 |     -1.50e-5 |     -2.40e-5 |     -1.20e-5 |
| 0.01   |   1.00e-2 |       0.01 |     -1.80e-5 |     -3.90e-5 |     -3.60e-5 |     -1.20e-5 |
| 0.02   |   2.00e-2 |    9.98e-3 |     -5.70e-5 |     -7.50e-5 |     -4.80e-5 |     -1.20e-5 |
| 0.03   |   3.00e-2 |    9.92e-3 |     -1.32e-4 |     -1.23e-4 |     -6.00e-5 |     -1.20e-5 |
| 0.04   |   3.99e-2 |    9.79e-3 |     -2.55e-4 |     -1.83e-4 |     -7.20e-5 |     -1.20e-5 |
| 0.05   |   4.97e-2 |    9.53e-3 |     -4.38e-4 |     -2.55e-4 |     -8.40e-5 |     -1.20e-5 |

The final value in the table is 0.0496875.
Computing the polynomial directly, using Microsoft Excel, yields 0.0496875.
There is 0% error between the method of finite differences and the direct calculation.

The significant improvement with the analytical engine was that the output of one calculation could be passed as input to another calculation.
The specific operations in each calculation step would be defined by the user with a punch card system,
inspired by the Jacquard looms. 
Though the analytical engine would never be built, the concepts of listing operations and storing values in memory became
fundamental to modern computing.
