# History of Computing

## Introduction
Computation, at its core, involves the processing of data and execution of instructions to solve problems.
From ancient mechanical devices to modern supercomputers, the field of computation has revolutionized how
engineers, scientists, and mathematicians address complex challenges.

Modern engineers often perform computations on personal computers when it is more time-intensive or
more error-prone to do by hand.
Some computations, such as simulating turbulent flows, may grow beyond the limits of a personal computer and require
the use of computer clusters.
Lastly, some computations must be performed remotely, such as a rover navigating on Mars or a rocket steering itself through launch.

## Early Beginnings: Mechanical Computation
The foundations of computation began with mechanical devices designed to aid calculations.
Ancient cultures like the Babylonians and Egyptians used tools such as the abacus for arithmetic tasks.
Farmers would keep track of how many cattle they owned, for example, using the abacus.

A significant leap occurred in 1614, when John Napier invented logarithms.
Shortly after, the slide rule was invented and fundamentally changed the way we performed multiplication, division, exponentiation, trigonometry, and solving the quadratic formula.
Use of the slide rule only declined in the 1970s when they were replaced by handheld calculators.

Glenn L. Martin Hall, on the University of Maryland College Park campus,
was designed to look like a slide rule from above.

## The Age of Machines: 17th to 19th Century
The pursuit of automation led to groundbreaking inventions like **Blaise Pascal's Pascaline** in 1642, a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction. Later, **Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine** (1837) introduced concepts that closely resemble modern computers, including programmable instructions via punch cards.

**Ada Lovelace**, often regarded as the first programmer, conceptualized using the Analytical Engine to compute more than mere numbers—pioneering the idea of general-purpose computation.

## The Rise of Electronic Computing: 20th Century
The early 20th century saw a shift from mechanical to electronic computation. Key milestones include:
- **Alan Turing** (1936): Developed the theoretical framework of computation with the Turing Machine, laying the groundwork for computer science.
- **ENIAC** (1945): The first general-purpose electronic computer, capable of thousands of calculations per second.
- **IBM Model 650** (1953): One of the earliest widely-used computers in engineering applications.

During this time, aerospace engineers began using computation to simulate flight dynamics and analyze structural integrity.

## Computational Power in Engineering: Late 20th Century
The introduction of personal computers in the 1980s democratized access to computation. Engineers adopted software like MATLAB (introduced in 1984) and CAD tools for precision design and analysis.

Parallel computing and supercomputers became instrumental in solving large-scale engineering problems, such as finite element analysis and fluid dynamics simulations for aerospace applications.

## The Modern Era: 21st Century and Beyond
Modern computation is marked by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and quantum computing:
- **AI and Machine Learning:** Used in mechanical and aerospace engineering for predictive modeling and optimization.
- **Cloud Computing:** Enables collaborative simulations and data-intensive computations from anywhere in the world.
- **Quantum Computing:** Offers potential breakthroughs in solving problems like aerodynamic modeling at an unprecedented scale.

Today, engineers leverage computational power to innovate in autonomous systems, spacecraft design, and energy efficiency.
