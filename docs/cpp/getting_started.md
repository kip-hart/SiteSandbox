## Local Install
We will use Visual Studio Code for learning C++.
You can download Visual Studio Code for free from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Once you have VS Code, visit [C++ in ENGR 101](https://engr101staff.github.io/engr101.org/assets/install-guide/guide.html#c-in-engr-101) for instructions on installing C++ on your computer.

## Cloud Service
If you have trouble with the install instructions, you can develop in C++ online on the [Replit](https://replit.com) site.
This is a cloud service that provides an environment to write and run C++ programs.
You can make it through the course using their free tier, and can sign up with your school email address.

You will get the most long term benefit from working in C++ locally instead of a cloud service.
